# ZemuX

ZemuX pronounced as "Zemu Ex". "Ex" means both "extended" and "experimental".

- Extended - the goal of this subproject is to extend Zemu to add slow memory support (e.g. as in the original ZX-Spectrum), support for wait machines (e.g. Scorpion ZS-256), and support for additional features and hardware (to be able to emulate PentEvo).
- Experimental - the goal of that subproject is to create a good project structure and architecture and rewrite everything in modern C++ (currently C++17 is chosen). Obviously, good old C (even C99) is much more portable than C++ (and don't tell me about cross-compiling), but modern C++ is a pretty good language and this experiment should show how much portability is practically necessary. Maybe the next Zemu will be written in Rust, who knows?
