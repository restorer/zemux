## Unreal Speccy

unreal is completely freeware. you may use this emulator
and it's sources without any restrictions. you may use
sources in your own emul or to release bugfixed/new versions.
in this case you do not have to release updated source code,
(unlike GNU Public License requires, for example). you may port
emulator to any other platform (but there is many
MSVC-specific language constructions, so it's doubtful that
you can compile it with another compiler)
